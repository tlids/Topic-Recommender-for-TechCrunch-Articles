# Topic-Recommender-for-TechCrunch-Articles
This is my forth project at Metis. I created a custom topic recommendation system based on TechCrunch articles using various NLP and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF, PCA, and clustering. In addition, I built an interactive web application using Flask, jQuery, and d3.js to demonstrate the recommendations.
